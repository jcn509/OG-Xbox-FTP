# OG Xbox FTP
A very simple Original Xbox App built with the [NXDK](https://github.com/XboxDev/nxdk) that provides only an FTP server without any graphics or controller support.

Currently uses code lifted straight from [NevolutionX](https://github.com/dracc/NevolutionX).

## Why?
This project exists to provide a way for pyxboxtest to edit HDD images by running an instance of this app and then using an FTP client to perform operations on the file system.

## TODO
- Refactoring to allow for testing
- Unit testing
